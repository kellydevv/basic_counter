✔goal: learn how to use useState and setState.

💪what I did:
1. make a new function by using useState.
2. give onClick eventHandler to button.

😎expected answer:
1. directly make arrow function in button with setState.

😜remarks:
I'm so excited that my level was changed just before I first studied this lesson.  I can think the algorithm and make my own code though it is not clean.
hopefully, I could change the css by using styled-components soon. thank you for reading my short and simple code and this readme! :)
